## Assignment: Caching the Inverse of a Matrix

## makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse
## It is a list containing functions to
## 1. set the value of the matrix
## 2. get the value of the matrix
## 3. set the value of the inverse
## 4. get the value of the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        s <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                s <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setSolve <- function(solve) s <<- solve
        getSolve <- function() s
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setSolve = setSolve,
             getSolve = getSolve)   
}

## cacheSolve computes the inverse of the matrix returned by makeCacheMatrix. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
## then the cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        s <- x$getSolve()
        if(!is.null(s)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(s)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        s <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setSolve(s)
        s
}
